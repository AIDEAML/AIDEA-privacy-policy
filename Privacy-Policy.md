Privacy Policy for AIDEA

AIDEA is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your data.

The only data we handle is the prompts inputted by the user which are stored locally on the user's device. No personal or sensitive data is collected, shared, or transferred.

Our extension requires 'storage' and 'activeTab' permissions for functioning. The 'storage' permission is used to locally store user prompts, while the 'activeTab' permission facilitates communication between different sections of the extension for a seamless user experience.

Our extension does not use remote code, ensuring a secure user experience.

We do not sell, share, or transfer any data to third parties.

For any concerns or questions regarding this privacy policy, please contact us at AIDEA7138@gmail.com. Great email right...
